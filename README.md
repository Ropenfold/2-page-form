## 2 Page Form Application

I created this application using Next.js. It is a framework which I feel comfortable with. I used the Nextjs form import to manage the form element. I had not used this before so this was one of the areas that required some thought as well as api calls and redirect. This is just an MVP based on the brief that was sent, If I was to expand this further I would build more 3rd party api calls into this, I'd create a call that could identify the car brand, model, age from the number plate, similar to how this is done on price comparison websites. I would also improve the css and UI.
